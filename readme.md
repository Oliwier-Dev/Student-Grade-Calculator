This is a fast side project for learning that I decided to post on GitHub.

You can input a student's name and grade (1–100), and the application will generate a report and display it in a table. You can also download the report as a CSV file.

Note:
This side project may contain some bugs because it wasn’t thoroughly tested. The goal was simply to learn how to work with CSV files and showcase my skills.
